## The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).
It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

### Compilation & Output
Your code will be compiled this way:

    $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
